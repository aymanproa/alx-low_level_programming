In C programming, functions are a block of code that performs a specific task. They are modular and reusable, making the code more organized and easier to maintain. Functions are declared at the beginning of the program and defined later in the code.

Nested loops are loops inside other loops. They are used to perform repetitive tasks multiple times with different inputs. Nested loops are commonly used in programming to iterate over multi-dimensional arrays or to create complex patterns.

In this section, you will learn how to create functions and use them in your code. You will also learn how to use nested loops to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. You will learn how to break out of loops and continue to the next iteration based on certain conditions. Additionally, you will learn how to create patterns using nested loops.
